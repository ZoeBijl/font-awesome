      <h1>How do assistive technologies handle Font Awesome?</h1>
      <p>This document lists different options to make icon fonts&mdash;delivered by <a href="https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a> on this page&mdash;accessible. It also lists the limitations of those options. Because these are just examples; all links are internal (they don't go anywhere).</p>

        <h2>Test one: <code>aria-hidden</code> on the icon</h2>
        <p>We can hide the icon from assistive technologies (AT for short) by adding <code>aria-hidden</code>. This will however not convey the meaning&mdash;or any other information it carries&mdash;to users of AT.</p>

        <section>
          <h3>Example</h3>

          <p>The link in this example has an icon of a bed before the text "Book a hotel". The icon is however hidden for AT with <code>aria-hidden</code>.</p>

          <p><a href="#book-hotel"><span class="fa fa-bed" aria-hidden="true"></span> Book a hotel</a></p>

          <p>
            <code>
              &lt;a href="#book-hotel"&gt;&lt;span class="fa fa-bed" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Book a hotel&lt;/a&gt;
            </code>

        <h2>Test two: visually hidden text and <code>aria-hidden</code> on the icon</h2>
        <p>Besides hiding the icon from AT, we can also provide visually hidden text that describes the icon or conveys its meaning. This example uses the popular <code>sr-only</code> class to mark an elment as <samp>for screen readers only".</p>

        <section>
          <h3>Example</h3>

          <p>The link in this example shows the GitHub logo without text. The icon is hidden for AT with <code>aria-hidden</code> and there is alternative text provided via the <code>sr-only</code> class.</p>

          <p>
            <a href="#github">
              <span class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></span>

          <li>Despite our smart use of <code>aria-label</code> the text is not part of the rendered text and thus not navigational in all AT/ browser combinations (JAWS/IE does not read out the aria-label).</li>

        <h2>Test four: <code>aria-label</code> and <code>role=img</code> on the icon</h2>
        <p>We can add alternative text via <code>aria-label</code>, but as Joanie explained <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2015OctDec/0062.html">this won't influence the icon node type</a>â€”which is still a text node; this causes issues because it allows for AT caret navigation (navigate text per character). We can work around this by adding <code>role="img"</code>; this turn the text node into a graphical node and thus disabled caret navigation.</p>

        <section>
          <h3>Example</h3>

          <p>The icon in the next paragraph shows a heart, but it replaces the word "love" in the sentence. If we follow the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/informative/">alternative text guidelines for informative images</a> we should use a literal description:</p>
          <blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/informative/">
            <p>In some situations a detailed literal description may be needed, but only when the content of the image is all or part of the conveyed information.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Every cool web project is made with <span class="fa fa-heart" role="img" aria-label="love"></span> these days. (And so is this one).</p>

          <p>
            <code>
              &lt;span class="fa fa-heart" role="img" aria-label="love"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            </code>
