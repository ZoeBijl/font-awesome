# Font Awesome
Assistive Technologies (AT) test for Font Awesome and icon fonts in general. We decided to do these tests after [Dylan raised an issue with Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/6133).

* All base test results are in `tests/index.html`
* A non-ARIA test bed can be found in `tests/plain-bed.html`

## Any help welcome
From code, to test results, to how to actually do decent testing. Anything is welcome.

## How to add a test

1. Copy the contents of test-template.html to tests/index.html
2. Write test
3. Do test
4. Make a pull-request with a short description
4. Be awesome!

## How to add results to a test

1. Either copy the example table row from test-template.html or;
2. copy a table row from tests/index.html
4. Make a pull-request with a short description
4. Profit?

## How to properly test

Depending on the icon coding technique, some or all of these scenarios will be worth testing.

In a screen reader:

1. Linear reading, e.g. screen reader "arrow navigation"
2. Read the icon and its text equivalent in the context of a link. Techniques vary by screen reader: e.g. tab key, rotor, or list of links
3. Read character-at-a-time, e.g. RightArrow
4. Read with a Braille display
5. Repeat the above tests with different verbosity settings, especially with settings related to punctuation.

Other configurations for accessibility:

1. Browser zoom: full page
2. Browser zoom: text-only
3. Windows high contrast mode
4. Text customizations (details TBD)
